# Anomaly Detection을 통한 도로 내 이상탐지

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a system that automatically detects various road hazards such
as potholes, roadkill carcasses, and faded lane markings. The goal is to enable road users
and authorities to identify and respond to these issues promptly, thus improving traffic safety.

## 2. 2. Background and Motivation
Problem Definition: Currently, identifying road issues (e.g., potholes, roadkill, faded lane
markings) relies heavily on manual patrols by road authorities or direct reports from the
public. Immediate reporting often occurs from only a small fraction of those who notice the
issues, leading to delays in addressing these road hazards. Such delays can significantly
impact driving safety and potentially cause accidents.

Motivation: To solve this issue, we propose using Object Detection technologies to quickly
identify road problems. This project aims to explore and implement such technologies to
create a practical solution that enhances road safety.
